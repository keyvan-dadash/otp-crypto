# OTP Crypto


### Intro

This repository was abandoned because at the time I was writing this, in our team, we were designing a security feature, but we didn't find any suitable and promising repository, so I decided to write this repository, but after writing it, we finally found a good and stable repository which is provided us with various features, so at that moment, developing this repository is meaningless, so currently, this repository is abandoned.

I found many useful source codes from various repositories, and I was trying to gather all those valuable methods in a single repository.
